# React App Documentation

This document provides an overview of the code implementation and structure of a React application that renders a web page with a responsive layout.

## Components

### Navbar

The `Navbar` component renders a navigation bar at the top of the web page.

### SliderSelect

The `SliderSelect` component allows the user to select a value using a slider.

### TenaureSelect

The `TenaureSelect` component allows the user to select from a set of predefined values using radio buttons.

### Result

The `Result` component renders a result based on the user's selection in the `SliderSelect` and `TenaureSelect` components.

### Container

The `Container` component provides a responsive layout and padding to its child components.

### Grid

The `Grid` component provides a responsive layout for its child components. The `Grid` container has two child components, one in the left column and one in the right column.

## App Function

The `App` function is the main component of the React application, which is responsible for rendering all other components. The `App` function returns a JSX element that represents the web page layout.

The `Navbar` component is called first, followed by the `Container` component, which wraps the `Grid` component. The `Grid` component has two columns, each with one child component. The left column contains the `SliderSelect` and `TenaureSelect` components, while the right column contains the `Result` component.
